Assigning Grammtical Gender to loanwords in Hindi-Urdu
How do native speakers of languages with grammatical gender know what gender to assign to words borrowed from another language? 
Traditionally, when borrowing from a language which encodes grammatical gender of its own, speakers simply inherit gender of the borrowed words from their parent language. 
But what about borrowing from languages that don’t assign grammatical gender?
Specifically, here I investigate how speakers of Hindi-Urdu assign grammatical gender to words borrowed from English.What makes the Hindi-English case particularly interesting is that unlike Hindi, English does not assign grammatical gender to its nouns. Yet, Hindi speakers easily assign words borrowed from English to one gender category or another.
This cross-linguistic genderassignment has been attributed to a few different speaker strategies in the existing loanword typology literature. One such strategy emphasizes the role of morphology as a predictor of gender. To put this strategy to test, I model the genderassignment process of English loanwords in Hindi as a function of the phonological similarity between a given loanword and the exiting words in the Hindi lexicon.
