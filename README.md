Assigning Grammtical Gender to loanwords in Hindi-Urdu



How do native speakers of languages with grammatical gender know what gender to assign to words borrowed from another language? 

Here I model the gender-assignment process of English loanwords in Hindi as a function of the phonological similarity between a given loanword and the exiting words in the Hindi lexicon.
What makes the Hindi-English case particularly interesting is that unlike Hindi, English does not assign grammatical gender to its nouns. Yet, Hindi speakers easily assign words borrowed from English to one gender category or another.
